# midi_piano
I had a lot of fun when I created this project. I take the toturial from "Simplfied dev" is really good instructor.the project is a midi piano every button represents a different frequency sound. I made this by audioCentxt api in js which have method called "createOscillator" which you can make sound in a specific frequency and connect it to your speaker
